	<h3>GENERAL CONDITIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS</h3>
	<h5>General Conditions</h5>
	<p>
		These General Conditions shall make an integral part of travel contract (hereinafter: 

Contract) regulating the rights and responsibilities of the tourist agency OnRusticRoutes 

as the travel organizer (hereinafter: ORR) and the person who takes or agrees to take 

the package (the principal contractor) or any person on whose behalf the principal 

contractor agrees to purchase the package (the other beneficiaries) or any person to 

whom the principal contractor or any of the other beneficiaries transfers the package 

(hereinafter: Consumer). 
	</p>
	<p>
		The Contract shall be binding on the contracting parties upon signing by an employee of 

the ORR or any other person duly authorized for the sales of ORR's travel arrangements 

and by the Consumer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Where it is not reasonably feasible that the Consumer signs the Contract, the Contract 

shall produce legal effects after ORR receives the full payment of the travel arrangement 

from the Consumer or a portion thereof, and in the latter case only after ORR receives 

the supporting documents evidencing indisputably the payment of the outstanding 

balance by the date previously agreed upon between ORR and the Consumer.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Reservations and payment</h5>
	<p>
		The Consumer may register for a trek organized by ORR via web pages of ORR or any

other agency authorized for sales of ORR travel arrangements, either in person or by 

any other means of remote communication, including telephone, facsimile, e-mail or any 

other communication means agreed upon between the contracting parties.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Consumer shall be obliged to provide personal data and all documentation 

requested by ORR and required for the purpose of organizing a trek. The Consumer 

shall be responsible for the content and the accuracy of the information submitted to 

ORR and shall accept all legal obligations deriving from the Contract and from laws and 

regulations in force.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unless otherwise provided for in a specific program, in order to confirm a reservation

the Consumer shall upon registration pay 30% of the price of the travel arrangement, 

and the remaining 70% of costs of the arrangement shall be paid by the Consumer no 

later than 45 days before the departure. In the latter case, the Consumer shall deliver to 

ORR documents evidencing indisputably the payment of the outstanding balance by the 

date previously agreed upon between ORR and the Consumer.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the Consumer fails to fulfill his payment obligation 45 days prior to the departure, the 

reservation shall be considered cancelled without the possibility of repayment of any 

sums paid by the Consumer.
	</p>
	<p>
		An “upon request” reservation made by the Consumer within less than 45 days prior to 

the date of a trip shall be processed by ORR within two business days (note please that 

Saturday and Sunday are not considered business days) and shall inform the Consumer 

thereon in writing or any other appropriate form.
	</p>
	<p>
		Where ORR is not able to ensure the requested arrangement within the stated term, the 

Consumer shall be repaid all sums paid by him/her under the Contract for the 

arrangement concerned.
	</p>
	<p>
		The “full refund” principle shall not apply to Consumer who fails to accept the 

reservation made by ORR upon their request.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, Consumer shall in no event shall be eligible for compensation, damages, costs 

or expenses resulting from the inability of ORR to make arrangements for trek as such 

arrangements are made based on availability of slots and internal capabilities of ORR. 

The only remedy available for Consumer is to seek refund and such refund would be 

made as per the terms of this Contract.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the case of “last minute” reservation confirmed by ORR upon Consumer’s request, the 

Consumer shall be required to make an immediate payment covering the full cost of the 

arrangement or to deliver to ORR documents evidencing indisputably the payment by 

the date previously agreed upon between ORR and the Consumer.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Costs</h5>
	<p>The prices of trips shall be indicated in the traveling program and shall be valid from the

day of advertising the program. Prices indicated in ORR programs shall be based on 

contracts with ORR partners and shall not necessarily be in conformity with prices 

advertised at the destination. Any price difference may not be subject to any objection 

or complaint.</p>
<p>
ORR may anticipate payments on the spot for specific services provided to the 

Consumer. The Consumer must communicate any failure in the provision of a service 

which he perceives on the spot directly to the supplier of the services concerned at the 

earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>
ORR may request an increase of the prices laid down in the Contract not later than 21 

days before the departure when it finds that it is constrained to revise significantly the 

price due to variations in ransportation costs, including the costs of fuel, dues, taxes or 

fees chargeable for certain services, such as landing taxes or embarkation or 

disembarkation fees at ports and airports, impacting the price of the trip, for reasons of 

unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond the control of ORR, the consequences 

of which could not have been avoided even if all due care had been exercised.</p>
<p>
In such a case, the price of the arrangement will be increased reciprocally to the 

increase of the prices of the elements based on which the price is calculated. ORR shall 

notify the Consumer as quickly as possible in order to enable him to take appropriate 

decisions. The Consumer hereby agrees to accept the alterations made and their impact 

on the contracted price up to 10%. If the increase of price exceeds 10%, the Consumer 

shall be entitled to cancel the arrangement and shall inform ORR of his/her decision 

within 2 business days from the receipt of notification from ORR. If the Consumer 

withdraws from the Contract, he/she shall not be entitled to be compensated by ORR for 

non-performance of the Contract. If the Consumer does not submit his/her cancellation 

to ORR in writing within the above stated time period, it shall be assumed that he/she 

agrees with the price change.</p>
<br>
<h5>Categorization and description of services</h5>
<p>The offered hotels and any other facilities on ORR programs shall be described

according to the official categorization of the respective destinations at the moment of 

the program's availability. Local categorization in individual destinations differs greatly. 

Accommodation, food, comfort and other services fall within the scope of responsibility 

of local and national tourist authorities, and therefore accommodation and service 

standards are different and incomparable and ORR shall not be deemed responsible for 

any such differences beyond the direct control of ORR.</p>
<p>

The accommodation arrangement in rooms is determined locally by the reception desk. 

If the Consumer had not specifically arranged a room with certain characteristics, he/she 

shall accept any officially registered and available room in each individual facility or 

destination described in the travel program. Unless otherwise indicted in the travel 

program, reserved rooms shall be available to the Consumer starting at 2 p.m. on the 

agreed arrival date and rooms must be vacated not later than 10 a.m. on the agreed 

departure date. ORR must be informed by the Consumer about later arrivals 

beforehand, and no later than one day before trek departure, if such a later arrival had 

not been foreseen in the travel program. </p>
<br>
<h5>Travel documents, compliance with laws and regulations</h5>
<p>
	A Consumer who registers for a trek must possess valid travel documents [including but 

not limited to address proof, Identity Proof and any other documents]. ORR shall 

provide the Consumer, in writing or any other appropriate form, before the contract is 

concluded, with general information on such documents, as well as with information on 

the health formalities required for the journey and the stay. During registration or by the 

deadline indicated in the program, the Consumer shall provide ORR with all information 

requested and documents necessary for the trek.
</p>
<p>
	The Consumer shall comply with customs, currency and any other laws and regulations 

applicable. If the Consumer cannot continue his/her journey due to non-compliance with 

laws and regulations, he/she shall bear all the costs incurring therefrom and shall 

personally deal with any consequences thereof.
</p>
<p>
	If the Consumer loses travel documents or finds them stolen during the trek, he/she 

shall personally bear the costs of issuance of new documents. The Consumer shall be 

responsible for securing that his/her personal conduct, his/her documents and luggage 

meet the requirements of customs, health and other regulations of India and Local laws 

with respect to destinations included in the travel program. The Consumer shall obey 

the rules of conduct in catering and hotel facilities and shall cooperate with the ORR and 

representative service providers in good faith. In the event of non-compliance, the 

Consumer shall be responsible for any damage resulting therefrom, and ORR shall 

assume no responsibility for such damage. In such a case, the remuneration for damage 

shall be settled by the Consumer and the owner or person responsible for the facility 

concerned (hotel, vehicle, boat, train, etc.,).
</p>
<p>
	ORR shall before the contract is concluded provide the Consumer with information 

sources about the destination. Please our website (<a href="www.onrusticroutes.com"  style="color:#cc682c;">www.onrusticroutes.com</a>) and 

examine the list of destinations evaluated as a high or moderate risk for travellers.
</p>
<p>
	Prior to the payment for a travel arrangement, all Consumers are invited to personally

inquire about the destination of travel and its travel requirements, taking into account 

the differences in provisions applicable to such destinations. ORR shall refer the 

Consumer to the relevant information sources, but it shall not in any way assume 

responsibility for consequences that may result for the Consumer from irreverence of 

such provisions or those that may be caused by invalid travel documents.
</p>
<p>
	Invalid travel documents as a consequence call for the termination of the travel shall not 

create any obligation for ORR and conditions for the termination of the travel shall be 

applied.
</p>
<br>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>
	Pursuant to the Act on Providing Services in Tourism, the ORR employees shall offer the 

Consumer a travel insurance “package” which is comprised of: voluntary health 

insurance during their stay, accident insurance, luggage insurance and travel 

termination insurance. By signing the Contract, the Consumer shall confirm that a travel 

insurance package has been offered. The insurance shall be contracted directly with an 

insurance company or with ORR, acting solely as an intermediary.
</p>
<br>
<h5>Travel termination insurance</h5>
<p>
	If during travel registration, the traveller foresees that he/she may terminate his/her 

trek due to specific situations, a travel termination insurance policy is highly 

recommended. The retrospective payment for travel termination insurance shall not be 

possible.
</p>
<p>
	Subject to a written confirmation, travel termination insurance shall be applied in case of 

military draft, illness, and death of an immediate family member. If the traveller does 

not hold a travel termination policy and must terminate his/her trek and has a 

confirmation of military draft, illness or death of an immediate family member, ORR shall 

be entitled to retainers in accordance with point 8 of these General Conditions. As a 

holder of a termination insurance policy, the Consumer shall settle all his/her claims with 

the insurance provider, and ORR shall provide the Consumer with all necessary 

documentation supporting his/her claims pertaining to the travel arrangement. Please 

read carefully the travel termination conditions as stated in the insurance policy.
</p>
<br>
<h5>Termination of trek by the Consumer</h5>
<p>
	Unless stated otherwise in the travel program, if the Consumer terminates a travel 

arrangement he/she already paid for, ORR shall be entitled to retain the following 

amounts of the total cost of the travel arrangement:
<ul>
	<li>up to 30 days before departure 10% of the travel arrangement price, no less than 100

HRK</li>
<li>29-22 days before departure 30% of the travel arrangement price</li>
<li>21-15 days before departure 40% of the travel arrangement price</li>
<li>14-8 days before departure 80% of the travel arrangement price</li>
<li>7-0 days before and after departure 100% of the travel arrangement price</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
	These retainers shall also apply to any changes in departure dates or accommodation 

facilities and to any other significant changes requested by the Consumer. If the 

Consumer as a contracting party terminates the travel contract, and finds another 

person for the same reservation that satisfies all the conditions applicable to the travel 

arrangement, ORR shall charge actual substitution expenses.
</p>

<br>
<h5>Iteration of travel by ORR or change of travel program</h5>
<p>
	If ORR significantly changes the program, accommodations or costs before the 

beginning of the trek, they shall notify the Consumer as quickly as possible in order to 

enable him/her to take appropriate decisions. The Consumer may either accept or refuse 

the alterations within 2 business days of receipt of ORR's notification. In the event of 

refusal or a failure to respond to the offer, ORR shall within 7 business days repay to the 

Consumer any sums paid by him/her. If the Consumer accepts the substitute travel 

arrangement offered by ORR, it shall constitute a new travel contract, whereby the 

Consumer shall wave his/her right to any claims against ORR derived from the initial 

Contract.
</p>
<p>
	Where, after departure, a significant proportion of the services contracted for is not 

provided or ORR perceives that they will be unable to procure a significant proportion of 

the services to be provided, ORR shall make suitable alternative arrangements, at no 

extra cost to the consumer, for the continuation of the trek, and where appropriate 

compensate the Consumer for the difference between the services offered and those 

supplied. The Consumer shall wave his/her claims against ORR possibly resulting from 

the difference between services contracted and services actually supplied. 
</p>
<p>
	If it is impossible for ORR to make such arrangements or these are not accepted by the 

Consumer for good reasons, ORR shall, where appropriate, provide the Consumer, at no 

extra cost, with equivalent transport back to the place of departure, or to another 

return-point to which the Consumer has agreed and shall, where appropriate, 

compensate the Consumer. The compensation shall cover the portion of the costs of the 

unused part of the contracted program. The compensation amount may not exceed the 

cost of the contracted travel arrangement.
</p>
<p>
	In the event of external unusual and/or unpredictable circumstances that could not have 

been prevented, avoided or eliminated, and which would have been a justified reason 

for ORR not to conclude the Contract if they has been present at the time of contract 

signing, ORR shall be authorized to terminate unilaterally the contract in its entirety or 

partially, with no obligation of compensating the Consumer for any damage resulting 

therefrom. However, the Consumer shall be entitled to be repaid any sum paid by 

him/her either in its entirety or in the amount covering the difference in the costs 

between the contracted and actually supplied services.
</p>
<p>
	ORR reserves the right to cancel any trek, no later than 5 days before the beginning of 

the trek, if the trek concerned was cancelled by the travel organizer for which ORR was 

an intermediary for the sales of such a travel arrangement or where the cancellation is 

on the grounds that the number of persons enrolled for the trek is less than the 

minimum required, or cancellation is for reasons of force majeure or for any other 

justified reason.
</p>
<p>
	ORR reserves the right to change the date or hour of the travel due to changes in flight 

schedules or due to the occurrence of unforeseeable circumstances, as well as the right 

to change the direction of travel if the conditions of travel change (flight schedule 

change, security situation, natural disasters or any other situations beyond the control of 

ORR), with no obligation of damage compensation and in accordance with valid 

regulations.
</p>
<p>
	ORR shall not be held responsible for changes due to unforeseeable circumstances and 

force majeure during the trek. In that case, ORR shall try their best to ensure services of 

equivalent or higher quality to the Consumer, depending on the given situation.
</p>
<p>
	ORR shall not be held liable neither for possible printing errors of programs within 

brochures/catalogues nor for incorrect data entry by the operator of ORR websites.
</p>
<br>
<h5>Trips organized by other organizers/tour operators</h5>
<p>
	These General Conditions shall apply to all travel arrangements organized directly by 

ORR, but they shall not apply to those in which ORR acts only as an intermediary, i.e. 

when ORR is not the principal tour organizer. Such travel arrangements shall be 

specially indicated in the program description and general conditions of the responsible 

organizer shall apply thereto. ORR shall not be held accountable for the implementation 

of tourist travel arrangements of other organizers. With the execution of the contract, 

the Consumer shall accept the program and the travel conditions in their entirety.
</p><br>
<h5>Resolution of complaints</h5>
<p>
	In cases of complaint, ORR shall make prompt efforts to find appropriate solutions. The 

Consumer shall be entitled to submit a complaint concerning failure to perform or 

improper performance of the contract. The Consumer must communicate any failure in 

the performance of a contract which he/she perceives on the spot to the supplier of the 

services concerned and to ORR in writing or any other appropriate form at the earliest 

opportunity. The Consumer should address a complaint to ORR in writing within 8 days 

after the finalization of the trip. Complaints delivered after the deadline of 8 days shall 

not be taken into consideration. As a contracting party, every Consumer shall deliver a 

complaint individually. ORR shall not take group complaints into consideration. All duly 

submitted complaints shall be responded to by ORR within 15 days after receiving the 

complaint by e-mail, mail or any other appropriate form. ORR shall address only those 

complaints supported by evidence that the Consumer has submitted a complaint to the 

service provider on the spot and that the cause of the complaint could not be eliminated 

on the spot.

information to the media.
</p><br>
<h5>Health regulations</h5>
<p>

may jeopardize the progress of the trek (either due to health or other reasons including 

a specific type of food required, chronic illness, allergies etc.). In specific programs 

special travel rules shall be indicated, including mandatory vaccinations and the 

acquisition of pertinent documentation. The Consumer shall execute mandatory 

vaccinations and shall hold and present to ORR the relevant documents thereof. It is 

highly recommended to obtain a health insurance policy.
</p><br>
<h5>Luggage</h5>
<p>
	ORR shall not assume any responsibility for the loss of or damage to luggage of their 

Consumers. Bus, and/or coach undertakings, Railways and air carriers shall be liable for 

the loss of or damage to luggage placed under their responsibility. Claims for lost 

luggage should be addressed to the transportation provider or hotel. It shall not be the 

responsibility to ORR to handle, manage or carry the luggage of the Consumer and

organizer</h5>

a database, in accordance with the Management of ORR, on methods of collection, 

processing and protecting personal data.
</p><br>
<h5>Information</h5>

a greater degree than the notifications and information indicated in the travel program 

itself.
</p><br>
<h5>Integral Part</h5>
<p>
	These General Conditions and Guidelines for Travel shall be an integral part of the 

Contract concluded between the Consumer and ORR or another tourist agency duly 

authorized for the sales of treks organized by ORR. The contracting parties are 

committed to seeking a proper, fair and timely resolution of a dispute. If the efforts to 

reach an amicable settlement of the dispute remain unsuccessful, the matter will be 

referred for decision to the competent court as per the terms of this Agreement.
