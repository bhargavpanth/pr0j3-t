Beer, shacks and seafood are not the only things radiate the Goan spirit.. We at “On Rustic Routes” are here to show to sights you’ll never forget and this is one such occasion. </p>
<p>
Today we take a look at dolphins, making leaps into the vastness of the Arabian Sea. This is going to happen right in front of your eyes and not on a HD television screen, making it better than the latest technology money can buy. </p>
<p>On our dolphin exploration, we take you into the vast sea and let you feast your eyes on the humpback dolphin and witness these masters of the water perform some breathtaking dives truly deserving a perfect score.</p>
<p>Our trip starts from the heavenly shores of Patnem Beach in South Goa. A classic wooden raft will pick you up from the shore and take you on a 30 min long boat ride into the waters till you witness water all around you.</p>
<p>Once you reach the spot of the dolphins, you must sharpen your observation and try to look out for the humpback, a breed of overly excited sea creatures. They make swift dives in and out of the water in peak glory. There are a lot of them performing dives in synchrony ideal for a  photography freak as these jumping dolphins make perfect postcard images. 
After this we stay in the calm waters for a while and witness the sunset from the middle of the ocean, a truly spectacular experience. From your boat you can witness a priceless view of the sunset as you sit there,enjoying a cold beer. Once the sun has set we return to the shore with many memories, pictures and most of all with a sense of oneness with nature.
