The name Hampi translates to champion and upon visiting its not hard to find out why this divine place has such a characteristic name.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, we will make our way to hippie island, a stretch of land riddled with large boulders and rocks. After a brief break, we will go towards the Sanapur lake, a serene and surreal water body, which acts as a transit for migratory birds. Post lunch, we will make our way to the Hanuman temple. Rumoured to be the birthplace of the monkey God Hanuman, this temple is located at the top of the Anjaneya Hill. Once on top, the view of the paddy fields and the ruins is absolutely mesmerizing. The river Tungabhadra can also be seen from the hills and the mighty beautiful surroundings will make you understand why Hampi was chosen as the capital of the Vijayanagara empire. Witness the sun set from this picture perfect hill and take in the raw spirituality and serenity the place has to offer. After your heart’s content we will make our way to the Laughing Buddha Inn where hot local delicacies and a warm bed awaits you.</p>
<p>Wake up and revere the sanctity of spirituality because on the second day we have a true adventure. Rock climbing is an adrenaline based sport which requires tremendous strength and these rocks are a feat every rock climber should accomplish. Scale the large rocky landscape using harnesses and safety rope and feel like a true king once you’ve reached the top. After a tiring start to the day, we will proceed towards something more relaxing. We’ve lined up a coracle ride across the Tungabhadra river which is both soothing and pleasurable. Feel the weariness wash away as you ride the river through its majestic glory. </p>
