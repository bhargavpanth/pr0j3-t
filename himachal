Long Itinerary  
<p>
Day One 
Manali (2,048m) - Chika (3,109m )</p>
<p>The trip will start with a drive up the mountains. After passing 40 hairpin bends and gaining an altitude of 2,987m you will arrive at Jobar. At this point we say our goodbyes to the roads and walk into the forest. Surrounded by Pine and Maple trees you will have a pleasant walk for about 30 mins. Following this you will walk into open grasslands amidst flowing rivers. You can choose to scale the rocky structures or walk along the stream to reach Chika, which is your campsite for the night. Pitch up your tents, sip some chai and prepare yourself for the adventures to follow. 
</p>
<p>
Day Two 
Chika (3,109m) - Balu ka Ghera(3,657m)
The trek will start post breakfast where you head away from the river and start a short ascent up the mountain. You will experience a rocky terrain, but nothing that is too difficult to trek. From here you will get a view of the snow covered Dhauladhar range and a waterfall. </p>
<p>You will then encounter the Rani Nala River, and walk alongside the river.After a brief walk you will  spot only patches of grass and flowers growing on the mountainside. In no time you will reach Balu-Ka-Gera, the campsite for the day. Balu-Ka-Gera translates to ‘bed of sand’ and gets its name because of the silt brought down by the river. </p>
<p>
Day Three 
Balu Ka Gera(3,657m.) -  Hampta Pass(4,297.6m.) - Siagoru(4,023m) 
Today is the day! You will reach the highest point of your trek. This will involve a steep ascent and a fast descent thereafter. For about an hour you will walk alongside the river; post this things will get adventurous.
The next part of the trip is a journey across 3 ridges. Each of them moderately challenging the climb. The first one will take about an hour and the other two will take you about thirty minutes each. At the end of this feat you will be at an altitude of 14,000 ft and atop the Hampta Pass. </p>
<p>
The descent down is actually what we refer to as an “adventure”. If there is a good layer of snow you may be able to slide down the hill with ease. If the snow is in patches then you will be forced to put effort into the descent and follow your guide in a zigzag path down. After a point you will reach the flat lands and take a “walk in the park” to reach your campsite for some well deserved rest.  </p>
<p>
Day Four
Siagoru (4,023m)  - Chatru(3,078m.)</p>
<p>The last day of the trek will surely have you pumped. The whole day is a constant descent. After an hour or so the trail down gets a little tricky. The presence of small rocks and grass in the path makes the trek a bit difficult. 
The whole way you will have a view of the Chatru road that you walk towards. The final campsite is at Chatru is on the banks of River Chandra. </p>
<p>
Day Five
Chatru(3,078m) - Chandratal- Chatru - Manali </p>
<p>Being in Spiti and not going to the famous Chandratal Lake is a big no-no. If road conditions permit us then you will be taken to Chandratal to witness this moon shaped wonder. It is a 70km. long drive which takes you through many sections off the road, a place unscraped by humanity bringing out the true adrenaline junkie feel.
If weather does not permit this, you will be taken back to Manali which also has an equally spectacular road which is riddled with scenic delights.</p>

On our way down we reach Chauda Modh, which in Hindi means ‘fourteen turns’. This place is called Chauda Modh because it is on the 14th hairpin bend of the road from Manali to Rotang. From the main road we start our trek through the tall grass and the lush greenery of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>On this trail, you will come across many different species of flowers and the climb is not very strenuous. 
This is the shortest leg of the trek and you will reach the campsite within the hour.</p>
<p>

<p>

Ravalikoli(3,750m) – Bhrigu Lake (4,235m) – Theli (3,500m)</p>
<p>
The day you reach the highest point of your trek is here!! This will be the most memorable day of the trek for two reasons. One- Because you reach the Bhrighu Lake and Two: because this is the hardest day of the trek. Today you will encounter the steepest climb of your trek. A 500meter climb, that will give you the thrill you need and a sense of accomplishment like nothing before. On the other side of this climb you will reach your destination. Feel free to explore the lake and enjoy the beauty. </p>
<p>Due to its holy significance this lake is restricted to trekkers for camping hence we will make a small descent to Theli and camp there, the most rustic campsite you will ever find in the course of the trek. </p>

<p>
Day Four- 
Theli(3,500m) – Vashisht (2,600m)</p>
<p>Your last day of the trek, the descent! The descent is always easy as long you have the right spirit and the right shoes. You will start early in the morning and trek your way down the hill. You will reach the tree line you left behind and come across the unique six feet high grass. Enjoy the descent and let your mind re-live the achievements of the trek. 
We will end our trek at Vashisht, the famous village of Manali region, popular for its hot water springs. You can choose to find a place to stay here or we can help you get back to the city of Manali and spend your time there. </p>
