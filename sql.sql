Everything from the rocky trails, the mystic valleys, a pine forest canopy and waterway crossings will pump up the adrenaline in your system! If the ever changing landscape is not enough for your appetite, you will also witness some of the rarest birds and flowers of the Himalayan region. This will  serve as a perfect trek to unwind and see what nature truly has to offer.</p>\n<p>This trek has the added advantage of having a unique Jeep Off-Roading experience like never before. </p>','<p>\nDay 1 : Manali(2,048m) - Jobra (By Jeep) - Trek to Chika \nDay 2 : Chika(3,109m) - Balu ka Ghera(3,657m)\nDay 3 : Balu Ka Gera(3,657m) - Hampta Pass(4,297.6m.) - Siagoru(4,023m)\nDay 4:  Siagoru(4,023m) -  Chatru (3,078m)\nDay 5: Chatru(3,078m)  - Chandratal- Chatru - Manali (JEEP OFF-ROADING)\n</p>',1,'<p>\nDay One \nManali (2,048m) - Chika (3,109m )</p>\n<p>The trip will start with a drive up the mountains. After passing 40 hairpin bends and gaining an altitude of 2,987m you will arrive at Jobar. At this point we say our goodbyes to the roads and walk into the forest. Surrounded by Pine and Maple trees you will have a pleasant walk for about 30 mins. Following this you will walk into open grasslands amidst flowing rivers. You can choose to scale the rocky structures or walk along the stream to reach Chika, which is your campsite for the night. Pitch up your tents, sip some chai and prepare yourself for the adventures to follow. \n</p>\n<p>\nDay Two \nChika (3,109m) - Balu ka Ghera(3,657m)\nThe trek will start post breakfast where you head away from the river and start a short ascent up the mountain. You will experience a rocky terrain, but nothing that is too difficult to trek. From here you will get a view of the snow covered Dhauladhar range and a waterfall. </p>\n<p>You will then encounter the Rani Nala River, and walk alongside the river.After a brief walk you will  spot only patches of grass and flowers growing on the mountainside. In no time you will reach Balu-Ka-Gera, the campsite for the day. Balu-Ka-Gera translates to \'bed of sand\' and gets its name because of the silt brought down by the river. </p>\n<p>\nDay Three \nBalu Ka Gera(3,657m.) -  Hampta Pass(4,297.6m.) - Siagoru(4,023m) \nToday is the day! You will reach the highest point of your trek. This will involve a steep ascent and a fast descent thereafter. For about an hour you will walk alongside the river; post this things will get adventurous.\nThe next part of the trip is a journey across 3 ridges. Each of them moderately challenging the climb. The first one will take about an hour and the other two will take you about thirty minutes each. At the end of this feat you will be at an altitude of 14,000 ft and atop the Hampta Pass. </p>\n<p>\nThe descent down is actually what we refer to as an \"adventure\". If there is a good layer of snow you may be able to slide down the hill with ease. If the snow is in patches then you will be forced to put effort into the descent and follow your guide in a zigzag path down. After a point you will reach the flat lands and take a \"walk in the park\" to reach your campsite for some well deserved rest.  </p>\n<p>\nDay Four\nSiagoru (4,023m)  - Chatru(3,078m.)</p>\n<p>The last day of the trek will surely have you pumped. The whole day is a constant descent. After an hour or so the trail down gets a little tricky. The presence of small rocks and grass in the path makes the trek a bit difficult. \nThe whole way you will have a view of the Chatru road that you walk towards. The final campsite is at Chatru is on the banks of River Chandra. </p>\n<p>\nDay Five\nChatru(3,078m) - Chandratal- Chatru - Manali </p>\n<p>Being in Spiti and not going to the famous Chandratal Lake is a big no-no. If road conditions permit us then you will be taken to Chandratal to witness this moon shaped wonder. It is a 70km. long drive which takes you through many sections off the road, a place unscraped by humanity bringing out the true adrenaline junkie feel.\nIf weather does not permit this, you will be taken back to Manali which also has an equally spectacular road which is riddled with scenic delights.</p>','<h3>Cost Includes:</h3>\n\n<p>\nTwin sharing tents available for the night along with food for the entire trip, Dining Tent will be present for storage and Sleeping bags (Holofill).\nDelicious food with high nutritious content perfect for high altitude trekking. \nTrekking Guides, cooks, camp helpers and support Staff will be provided.\nMule with Mulemen to carry loads on the route. \n(There is a 10 kg weight limit for your bags that will go on mule)\n(You are expected to carry a small carry on bag of about 20L for camera, water and carry on food) \n</p>\n\n<h3>Cost Excludes:</h3>\n\n<p>\nAny expenses of personal nature like phone calls, personal medication, transport and air/rail ticket to reach the starting point of the trek. \nHotel or Accommodation needs on days apart from trek days. \nAnything not mentioned above in \"Cost Included\" \n</p>\n\n<h3>Suggested thing to carry:</h3>\n\n<p>\nOne backpack of 40- 50 Liters capacity (Rain cover for the bag is suggested).

This drive is done for acclimatizing the trekker and also, we donât want you to miss the scenic drive. On our way down we reach Chauda Modh, which in Hindi means âfourteen turnsâ. This place is called Chauda Modh because it is on the 14th hairpin bend of the road from Manali to Rotang. From the main road we start our trek through the tall grass and the lush greenery of the Himalayas.</p>\n<p>On this trail, you will come across many different species of flowers and the climb is not very strenuous. \nThis is the shortest leg of the trek and you will reach the campsite within the hour.</p>\n<p>\nThe campsite is in the tree line of the mountain and thus you will be able to light a small bonfire at night. The camp also gives a stunning view of the Hanuman Tibba. </p>\n\n<p>Day Two \nChauda Mod(3,250m) â Ravalikoli (3,750m)</p>\n<p>\nThe next morning begins with a nutritious breakfast and initiates the first long day of the trek. On this leg of the trek you will cross the tree lines and witness the lush greenery. Many changes in the terrain will be seen on this leg - from grassy to rocky. En route the next campsite, you will also pass by a few streams and waterfalls - something that you wonât experience in the concrete jungle.</p>\n<p>Half way through the trek you will enter the flat lands and the trek will become easy.

Today you will encounter the steepest climb of your trek. A 500meter climb, that will give you the thrill you need and a sense of accomplishment like nothing before. On the other side of this climb you will reach your destination. Feel free to explore the lake and enjoy the beauty. </p>\n<p>Due to its holy significance this lake is restricted to trekkers for camping hence we will make a small descent to Theli and camp there, the most rustic campsite you will ever find in the course of the trek. </p>\n\n<p>\nDay Four- \nTheli(3,500m) â Vashisht (2,600m)</p>\n<p>Your last day of the trek, the descent!

You will reach the tree line you left behind and come across the unique six feet high grass. Enjoy the descent and let your mind re-live the achievements of the trek. \nWe will end our trek at Vashisht, the famous village of Manali region, popular for its hot water springs.
