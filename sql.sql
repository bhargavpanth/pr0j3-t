After passing 40 hairpin bends and gaining an altitude of 2,987m you will arrive at Jobar. At this point we say our goodbyes to the roads and walk into the forest. Surrounded by Pine and Maple trees you will have a pleasant walk for about 30 mins. Following this you will walk into open grasslands and  amidst flowing rivers. You can choose to scale the rocky structures or walk along the stream to reach Chika, which is your campsite for the night. Pitch up your tents and sip some chai and prepare yourself for the adventures to come. \n\n<b>Day Two </b>\nChika (3,109m) - Balu ka Ghera(3,657m)\nThe trek will start post breakfast where you head away from the river and start a short ascent up the mountain. You will experience a rocky terrain, but nothing that is too difficult to trek. From here you will get a view of the snow covered Dhauladhar range and a waterfall. \nYou will then encounter the Rani Nala River, and walk alongside the river.After a brief walk you will only spot only patches of grass and flowers growing on the mountainside. In no time you will reach Balu-Ka-Gera, the campsite for the day. Balu-Ka-Gera translates to ‘bed of sand’ and gets its name because of the silt brought down by the river. \n\n<b>Day Three </b>\nBalu Ka Gera(3,657m.) -  Hampta Pass(4,297.6m.) - Siagoru(4,023m) \nToday is the day! You will reach the highest point of your trek. This will involve a steep ascent and a fast descent after. For about an hour you will walk alongside the river, post this things will get adventurous.\nThe next part of the trip is a journey across 3 ridges. Each of them moderately challenging the climb. The first one will take about an hour and the other two will take you about thirty minutes each. At the end of this feat you will be at an altitude of 14,000 ft and atop the Hampta Pass. \n\nThe descent down is actually what we refer to as an “adventure”. If there is a good layer of snow you may be able to slide down the hill with ease. If the snow is in patches then you will be forced to put effort into the descent and follow your guide in a zigzag path down. After a point you will reach the flat lands and take a “walk in the park” to reach your campsite for some well deserved rest.  \n\n<b>Day Four</b>\nSiagoru (4,023m)  - Chatru(3,078m.)\nThe last day of the trek will surely have you pumped. The whole day is a constant descent. After an hour or so the way down gets a little tricky. The presence of small rocks and grass in the path make the trek harder. \nThe whole way you will have a view of the Chatru road that you walk towards. The final campsite is at Chatru is on the banks of River Chandra. \n\n<b>Day Five</b>\nChatru(3,078m) - Chandratal- Chatru - Manali \nBeing in Spiti and not going to the famous Chandratal Lake is a big no-no. If road conditions permit us then you will be taken to Chandratal to witness this moon shaped wonder. It is a 70km. long drive which takes you through many sections off the road, a place unscraped by humanity bringing out the true adrenaline junkie feel.\nIf weather does not permit this, you will be taken back to Manali which also has an equally spectacular road which is riddled with scenic delights.\n','<b>Cost Includes:</b>\n\nNight Camping Tents (Twin Sharing) , Kitchen equipment and services, Storage and Dining Tent and Sleeping bags (Holofill).\nDelicious food with high nutritious content perfect for high altitude trekking.

Its a place of the legends. Locals say that Bhrighu \r\n\r\nRishi meditated here. Also the famous Guru Vashist was rumoured to have come to this sacred \r\n\r\nlake once in two years, the lake being blessed by him never freezes even at the lowest of \r\n\r\ntemperatures.\r\n\r\nThe trek is fun and simple.

This drive is done for acclimatizing the trekker and also, we don’t want you to miss the scenic drive. On our way down we reach Choda Modh, which in Hindi means ‘fourteen turns’. This place is called Choda Modh because it is on the 14th hairpin bend of the road from Manali to Rotang. From the main road we start our trek through the tall grass and the lush greenery of the Himalayas.\nOn this trail, you will come across many different species of flowers and the climb is not very strenuous. \nThis is the shortest leg of the trek and you will reach the campsite within the hour.\n\nThe camp site is in the tree lines of the mountain and thus you will be able to light a small bonfire at night. The camp also gives a stunning view of the Hanuman Tibba. \n\nDay Two \nChoda Mod(3,250m) – Ravalikoli (3,750m)\n\nThe next morning begins with a nutritious breakfast and initiates the first long day of the trek. On this leg of the trek you will cross the tree lines and witness the lush greenery. Many changes in the terrain will be seen on this leg - from grassy to rocky. En route the next campsite, you will also pass by a few streams and waterfalls - something that you won’t experience in the concrete jungle.\nHalf way through the trek you will enter the flat lands and the trek will become easy. Just nature and you all the way. \nYou will then set up camp at Ravalikoli alongside a stream with a view of the snow patches and the steep rocky trails. \n\nDay Three - \nRavalikoli(3,750m) – Bhrigu Lake (4,235m) – Theli (3,500m)\n\nThe day you reach the highest point of your trek is here!! This will be the most memorable day of the trek for two reasons. One- Because you reach the Bhrighu Lake and Two: because this is the hardest day of the trek. Today you will encounter the steepest climb of your trek. A 500meter climb, that will give you the thrill you need and a sense of accomplishment like nothing before. On the other side of this climb you will reach your destination. Feel free to explore the lake and enjoy the beauty. \nDue to its holy significance this lake is restricted to trekkers for camping hence we will make a small descent to Theli and camp there, the most rustic campsite you will ever find in the course of the trek. \n\n\nDay Four- \nTheli(3,500m) – Vashisht (2,600m)\nYour last day of the trek, the descend! The descends are always easy as long you have the right spirit and the right shoes. You will start early in the morning and trek your way down the hill. You will reach the tree line you left behind and come across the unique six feet high grass. Enjoy the descend and let your mind re-live the achievements of the trek. \nWe will end our trek at Vashisht. The famous village of Manli region popular for its hot water springs.
